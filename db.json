The Brownings and the Mossbergs, the angry Colts -- do not fear them: You will never find such as these on your path, if your thoughts remain lofty, if a fine emotion touches your spirit and your body. The StrapGuns and the Uzis, the fierce Technines you will never encounter, if you do not carry them within your soul, if your soul does not set them up before you. Pray that the road is long.... ",

      "content": "A ferret visited my house with little tiny cymbals. I felt that I should pick him up but couldn't find my thimbles.He jumped into my dresser drawer (The one with rags and papers) I slammed it shut and taped it tight and gave it to the neighbors.The neighbors liked the furniture but did not like the ferret. They took it to a hardware store to trade it for a parrot.The parrot, now, it sings to me across the narrow alley. I'd like to take it far away, But it's too big to carry.If animals come in your house just make them go away. You can give them to your friends but still you'll have to pay.",

      "content": "This is the story\nOf a pumpkin of white\nWhat is its place on this autumn night?\nAmidst all the orange and colors of fall\nIt seems out of place; not belonging at all\nBut oh what a place, and oh what a story\nYou see, in its face lies the image of glory\n\nOf babies so small, so incredibly tiny\nPerfect in purpose, their souls shining brightly\nNo less a baby, a child just the same\nAs one who was held and called by their name\nWas my baby a he?\nOr was she a she?\nWhat would my child have grown up to be?\nYet bigger than questions and what ifs and whys\nIs the comfort they feel when they look to the skies\nFor their hope is the truth that they so tightly cling\n“I’ll know all the answers, understand everything\non the day that God hands my child back to me”\n\nThis pumpkin is sweet baby boys and girls\nWho never opened their eyes to this world\nNever cried, never feared\nProtected from pain\nTouched by their innocence\nWe’re never the same\nLives perfect and pure\nAll things lovely and sweet\nAnd we honor them here\n‘Till heaven we meet\n\nThis pumpkin is all of the sweet little ones\nWhose lives although short were covered in love\nIn kisses and snuggles, rocking and playing\nTheir parents not knowing they wouldn’t be staying\nBut the time that they had they would never trade\nEven if they could be saved from the pain\nTheir cribs may be empty, but the promise remains\nOne day they’ll hold their babies again\n\nThis pumpkin is for all these sweet angel friends\nWhose parents all know this isn’t the end\nAnd how they are doing\nTonight up in heaven\nIs better than anything we could imagine\nThough we’re missing our children\nAnd we’re still on this side\nOur hearts will continue to swell with pride\nAt the special, the wondrous, the out of place things\nLike this white pumpkin, and the joy that it brings\nA reminder that our children are more than alive\nThey are perfectly whole, all things are made right\n\nAngel parents, I know there’s still tears to be shed\nBut I hope that this pumpkin brings peace instead\nOur babies are promised forever in heaven\nAnd that’s the best gift we could ever be given",
